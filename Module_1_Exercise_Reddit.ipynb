While the measures to contain Covid-19 have been taken from a public health perspective, they have crippled the airline industry and presented us at Singapore Airlines with the greatest challenge in our history.\\n\\n\\nOur customers and staff always remain our top-priority. That principle guided many of our decisions over the last two months as we responded to the increasingly global scale of the outbreak, as well as the growing number of border closures that have decimated air travel.\\n\\n\\nWe know that you trust us to deliver a safe flying experience and ground environment. That is why we modified our in-flight service to reduce the risks to our customers and crew while in the air, and stepped up our cleaning and disinfection procedures both in the aircraft and our ground facilities such as the SilverKris lounges.\\n\\n\\nEven as we scaled back our operations due to the borders closures, we understood that many of you and your loved ones needed to return home as soon as possible. And you trusted us to make that possible. That is why, despite the fast deteriorating operating economics, we persisted with services to key cities for as long as we could.\\nWe have received many encouraging notes from our customers over the last few weeks. Thank you, your warm words of appreciation mean a great deal to us during this trying time.\\n\\n\\nAt the same time, we also know that many of you have been adversely affected by the large-scale flight cancellations. I sincerely apologise for this.\\nOur teams have received an unprecedented volume of calls, messages and emails over the last few weeks. While we ramped up the handling capacity at our customer services centres, a few of our overseas contact centre operations were disrupted by government-imposed lockdowns. As a result, we know that we might have caused you considerable frustration and anxiety. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we do everything we can to support your needs, and respond to you as soon as possible.\\nIn view of the uncertainty amid the Covid-19 outbreak, the value of the unused portion of your tickets will be retained as flight credits when your flight has been cancelled or if you would like to postpone your travel. You can use those credits to make a new booking any time from now until 31 March 2021. We have also waived no-show and rebooking fees. Please contact us here when you firm up your new travel plans.\\n\\n\\n\\nI would also like to share that we will automatically renew all KrisFlyer Elite and PPS Club membership statuses for another 12 months at the end of their membership year. This applies to all memberships expiring from March 2020 through to February 2021. The validity of any expiring PPS and Elite Gold Rewards will also be extended until 31 March 2021.\\n\\n\\nThis is a small token of our appreciation for your loyalty and support, which we value greatly as we work hard to get through this outbreak.\\nFor more than 70 years, SIA has set the standard for in-flight products and services in the aviation industry. It remains unclear when the Covid-19 outbreak will be brought under control. But when it does, you can be sure that we will be ready to welcome you back on board and deliver, once again, the exceptional service that you have come to expect and are familiar with.\\nUntil then, please stay safe and healthy',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I think that although there was a delay between the time China released news of the virus and the time the outbreak occured (thus no way to have stopped the first batch of tourists/returnees from Wuhan from entering SG), we could have stopped the vast majority of cases from entering Singapore by closing our borders to at least all flights from China, on the first week we received notice of the virus.\\n\\nSo some of you may say, that is an unreasonable course of action at the time because it was not announced as a pandemic yet, etc. so to close our borders immediately on the premise of a possibly contained virus is uncalled for. But I think that any kind of easily contact spread virus = grounds for at least immediate border closure to all flights originating from the country of the epidemic. We did not do this for MERS-CoV because MERS is difficult to transmit from person to person even with close contact, so the chances of it become a pandemic is low. But all viruses that are easily contact spread from person to person such as Covid have high potential to become pandemics. It is a cause to raise the alarm immediately. This is especially the case for Singapore because the majority of our tourists come from China and we get large numbers of Chinese tourists every day (before Covid) and therefore we are one of the most at risk communities. \\n\\nNow that we only made the decision to totally close borders two weeks ago, we take on an unnecessary increase in casualties and economic damage. Since the end outcome was total border closure anyway, the net loss for the country = present and future costs incurred due to additional influx of cases - revenue earned from keeping borders open for a few more weeks. If I do very simplistic calculations based on tourism and investment gains from 2018, the immediate loss incurred from a border closure on day 1 of receiving notice, is about 3 billion\\'s worth in 3 weeks - far less than the 40+ billion we are setting aside for current and future measures.\\n\\nOf course, there would be some more cases after border closure due to people getting infected with the first wave of tourists/returnees but not manifesting symptoms until 2 weeks later (hence possibly spreading it during this time). But I think it would be far less than the amount we currently have due to keeping borders open for another few weeks before closure, letting more infected people enter and spreading the disease. \\n\\nMy opinion is that the initial low number of cases (80-100) and the slow rate of increase (several to ten a day) made us complacent of the situation, that we overlooked the possibility that it was the calm before the storm and that there were many potential cases still brewing in our midst (now showing symptoms). So now we have the second wave, which is all the people who came in before and during those few weeks when the borders were still open/ those that interacted with them.\\n\\nSo the conclusion is, if I were the government, I\\'d have taken a guaranteed few billions in economic loss over potential tens of billions, and closed the borders to at least all China incoming flights (or all flights) upon receiving notice of a easily contact spread widespread epidemic. Perhaps it would not have been \"reasonable\" then, but looking back at it from now it would have been the correct thing to do, since we ended up having to do it anyway. The short term infection figures from a virus with a long incubation time and being asymptomatic during that period are VERY misleading, and to base measures off those figures is a mistake that practically every country made and hence are facing the same pattern of a huge spike in cases. I think this is a lesson to learn about the pattern of how pandemic cases rise and we need to prepare for the correct initial response if such situations ever happen again. Our ability to control and mitigate the impact of the outbreak is definitely top class, but it would be better if we always acted to avoid the disaster before it has a chance to occur.',\n",

If we use MOH\\'s local unlinked cases of 139, only 48 components are not accounted for. In other words, only around 25% of local cases which cannot be linked to an imported case become subsumed under \"local linked\".\\n\\nIn fact, some time have passed from the local unlinked casess, so the actual numbers of concern would be lesser. And we also know this by MOH\\'s latest press releaase (2\\'nd April), which states that \"Contact tracing is underway for 118 locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to affected countries or regions.\"\\n\\nIt took an embarrassingly long time to compile the data, even though what I did was relatively brain dead most of the time. It does require a lot of attention though. I can imagine how much more effort is required to perform the contact tracing and investigations. I suppose that the effort scales linearly with the number of cases, but if the number of cases grows exponentially, then the effort required is going to increase exponentially as well, which is not something you can sustainably throw fresh untrained humans in to solve before hitting a bottleneck. \\n\\nIn other words, contact tracing is really effective at keeping us in the containment phase. But if we do not play our part to try keep the numbers down, it\\'ll become impossible to contact trace and the DORSCON Pantone Chart will run out of orange. So please please please, be as socially responsible as possible.\\n\\nTL;DR: it\\'s OK to rely on MOH\\'s data directly without additional processing to get a relatively accurate picture of the situation. Please practice social responsibility too.',\n",

Gawd I wish I bought a Zoids kit while I was window-shopping now that I’ve discovered they move again.\\n\\n- Video game consoles for people who will suddenly have loads of time to play soon.\\n\\n- Exercise equipment for the family.

This means no more going out, job security is threatened, safety is at risk and things are uncertain. \\n\\nTo Singaporeans: do not make us go down.\\n\\nCurrently we are able to tide things through using whatever financial budget that Singapore has. Easing on payments, giving out stimulus and every other measures. The government has tried pumping in a lot of resources into all these tests, stay home notices and other measures. \\n\\nThis is not a long term solution for us Singaporeans. Throwing money into the pit to try and slow down the spread.\\n\\n 'Gahment so much money, can one la'. Of course Singapore can spend this much money but that doesn't mean we should be spending it. Cause these money is from all of us, saved up and spent wisely. \\n\\nThe government is doing their best in their own ways to resolve this problem. But as long as Singaporeans continue to act irresponsibly, this situation will either become A) we run out of resources B) we can kiss our stability as a nation goodbye. \\n\\nSome cultures are toxic, that i agree. Workplaces calling people chao geng for MC-ing from work. Sick people are hence socially obligated to go in even if sick, only to become the scapegoat when shit hits the fan. \\n\\nSome people think 'aiya, wont happen one. Whats the chance? I so healthy'. Young people like that, good luck. Hope you don't get infected because your mentality will be what drags the entire country down. Just recall the Korean Ajumma. \\n\\nLet us fight this together as Singaporeans. Respect our healthcare workers, supermarket staffs and all other workers who make the country continue to run. Let us be more responsible for our own nation, or at the minimum, to our own closed ones. \\n\\nThis virus can make us go down. Let's not make that happen.\",\n",

My dad is a taxi driver and has been complaining that there is 1-2 calls per day and he works from morning till night time. He also claims that the company hasnt done anything yet and he still have to pay rental fee and all. oil prices are expensive as well and the profit he earned is not even enough to pay for the rent/oil fees. after the circuit breaker starts next week, this situation would get worsen.. and im very worried because he has been borrowing money to pay off rental fee\\n\\nIm not too sure if grab came out anything to ease the financial burden of the drivers but if they havent/do not plan to do so, its rlly very unethical of them. Yes, reducing collection of rental fees may cause them to lose profit but at this current situation, other than companies that sells mask/sanitiser, who else are earning? they cant just earn from the drivers when they cant even find customers to drive.\\n\\nA little more context for my fam, my parents are quite old, my mum had cancer and my dad have to fetch her to hospital and then back home, so shes not earning already. my dad is the sole bread winner at home but he dont even have enough money to pay for rental fee. How are we gna survive thru this shit. I worked part time as a private tutor while studying in Uni and because of this circuit breaker thing, the parent has requested for suspension of tuition. right now, we are only living off from my mothers savings and say real, this is def not a long term solution.\\n\\nIm rlly quite affected from this coronavirus thing as well as worrying for my father.. how come comfort cancels rental fee for their drivers but grab still did nth to help them. many of the drivers are old and have medical condition.. totally no empathy at all? sigh.

These make Pitta a prime target for counterfeit production, trying to opportune the market share.\\n\\nThere are many **made in China fake** Pitta masks going around. Anyone could order these in bulk from Tao Bao or Ali. Some of these people who buy in bulk may not even know at first that these are fake, and sell them innocently.\\n\\nAs wearing of masks will be wide-spread now, it'll start to become a **lifestyle** or a fad, as least for next 6-12 months. Many will start to see people wearing these nice looking masks and want to buy from Carousell, Shopee, etc.\\n\\nIf you wish to get a Pitta:\\n\\n\\\\- Do google on 'real fake Pitta' and you will see examples of the fake ones. Ask the sellers to show you a live photo of their masks as many will just use professional photos in their listing.\\n\\n\\\\- Its fairly **easy to spot the fakes** just from the outside packaging.\\n\\n\\\\- There are sellers who sell the genuine ones and warn / educate buyers of the fake ones on their listings.

He gave his best &amp; got a decent % of vote, perhaps if he did continue pursuing politics in the right way, he would’ve made it one day, in a small way or another. \\n\\nHowever, of late, his posts (similarly like the smaller opposition parties) have been of hate. Thing is, we really do listen. When they draft a long post about Singapore’s politics, I’m sure people read them. But they disagree on everything, bad policies, good policies. \\n\\nNo one likes an non graceful person. Imagine being at a friends party, and a guy walks in announcing arrogantly that he could run the party better and the host sucks. That is exactly what they are. Imo, if they want even a little success, learn from the professionalism and poise of WP. \\n\\nThis post is not to hate on them, I support a multi part opposition and hope they buck up.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"The Circuit Breaker can be stressful or anxiety-inducing for some people, myself included. For myself, being out everyday isn't really a matter of choice, and in fact was encouraged by my therapist as the most ideal way to deal with my current situation (that was before the whole COVID-19 outbreak). But for now, staying home is the socially responsible thing to do.\\n\\nFor those in the same boat as me, here are some tips I hope can ease your stress or anxiety during this period:\\n\\n1. Read up on mental health coping tips online. \\n\\nA good place to start would be the US CDC's guide on [Mental Health and Coping During COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html).\\n\\n\\n2. If you need to talk to someone, the Singapore Government is setting up a [dedicated Covid-19 hotline offering emotional support](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/government-to-set-up-covid-19-hotline-offering-emotional-support). \\n\\nI'll update this post with more details once the hotline is set up.\\n\\n\\n3. There are other mental health support hotlines that should be available during this period too. A list is available on [HealthHub](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/support-groups-and-others/20/call-on-these-when-you-need-help).\\n\\nOne very important number to note is the Samaritans of Singapore hotline at 1800-221-4444.  \\n\\n\\n4. Check out important links and things to do on the r/Singapore [COVID-19 pinned post](https://reddit.app.link/DHtf2sZMr5).  \\n\\n\\n5. At home, when dealing with abusive or toxic relationships, consider whether it would be worthwhile to fix these broken relationships or to try to avoid contact with the person as much as possible. While no one including me can make this choice for you, please do seek a mental health professional's advice before proceeding.  \\n\\n\\n6. If you have the budget, sign up for streaming services and make a list of all the shows you want to watch. Try to focus on options that will make you happy or those that help improve your life. It's also the perfect time to sign up for one-month trials of these streaming services.  \\n\\nIf paying for streaming services isn't an option, consider free NLB e-books &amp; magazines on [Libby/OverDrive](https://nlb.overdrive.com) and PressReader. Of course, podcasts and YouTube are a great free way to pass time too.  \\n\\n\\n7. If you have more money, consider investing in a pair of active noise cancelling headphones because it will help you block out external noise and distractions.  \\n\\n\\n8. Go out for walks at your park or help shop for groceries and essentials. Fresh air and a change of atmosphere, no matter how short, helps in improving your mood. Do remember to practice safe distancing, wear a mask and check the apps to ensure your public park or shopping mall isn't crowded when you head out.    \\n\\n\\n9. If you really can't stay at home, especially if your safety is concerned, consider volunteer roles that help the community during this period. One option I can think of is the [SG Clean Ambassadors Network](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5e7484a2ca6a010011862c59). You can also go to [SG Cares Volunteer Page](http://www.volunteer.sg) to see more volunteer roles. If you want to earn some extra cash, I think applying for roles such as food delivery rider would be of great help during this time as there would be lots of demand.\\n\\n\\nThis list isn't meant to be exhaustive and I hope the community can contribute some points as well. Take care and stay safe!\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'The Workers\\' Party (WP) is likely to field fewer newcomers at the coming polls than in the last general election, focusing its firepower on its regular stomping grounds instead of expanding into new areas.\\n\\nIn the 2015 General Election, the WP had a bumper crop of 16 new faces. But this time, only a handful may be fielded, with the party unlikely to venture beyond Aljunied GRC, East Coast GRC, Marine Parade GRC and the newly created Sengkang GRC as well as Hougang SMC, party insiders said.\\n\\nParty chief Pritam Singh had said at the WP members\\' forum in January: \"For the upcoming general elections, we will field candidates that the public can envision to become competent MPs and parliamentary backbenchers and who will manage their town councils well. The focus will be on quality candidates from a range of backgrounds and life experiences.\"\\n\\nWhile the party has not officially presented them, some have been spotted knocking on doors and helping at community events in Marine Parade GRC, East Coast GRC and the areas that make up the new Sengkang GRC.\\n\\nSince last year, Mr Peter Tan, an information technology professional in his early 50s, has been seen often with former WP electoral candidates Yee Jenn Jong and Firuz Khan making the rounds in Marine Parade GRC.\\n\\nLong-time party member Nathaniel Koh, in his 30s, who was in the WP\\'s youth wing executive committee in 2009 and has volunteered in Mr Singh\\'s Meet-the-People sessions in the past few years, has also been seen at house visits in the group representation constituency.\\n\\nIn neighbouring East Coast GRC, former National Solidarity Party candidate Nicole Seah, 33, has been walking the ground with WP. She started as a volunteer after the 2015 polls, but has since become a party member.\\n\\nAnother possible new face at the GRC, party sources say, is lawyer Fadli Fawzi, who is in his 40s and has volunteered at Mr Singh\\'s Meet-the-People sessions.\\n\\nIn the north-east, the party is said to be considering two newcomers for its team at the four-member Sengkang GRC, which takes in Punggol East and Sengkang West SMCs as well as parts of Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.\\n\\nAmong the new faces spotted there is Ms Raeesah Khan, 26, who founded Reyna Movement to empower women through different programmes.\\n\\nAnother potential candidate for the area is associate professor of economics Jamus Lim, 44, at Essec Business School. Associate Professor Lim\\'s credentials have been widely quoted in the media since he was identified as a possible WP candidate. He holds several degrees, from Harvard University, University of California, London School of Economics and University of Southern Queensland.\\n\\nThe Straits Times understands that former Punggol East MP Lee Li Lian, who won a by-election in the then single-member constituency in 2013, has been introducing Ms Raeesah and Prof Lim to residents in the Sengkang area.\\n\\nMeanwhile, equity analyst Louis Chua has been seen donning party blues and walking with Prof Lim, and is speculated to also be a possible choice for the GRC.\\n\\nhttps://www.straitstimes.com/politics/wp-likely-to-field-fewer-new-faces-this-ge?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=STFB&amp;utm_source=Facebook#Echobox=1585721146',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Before the start of HBL, I request any parent to have some empathy towards the teachers that teach your children. It’s going to be hard to get used to. I know teachers are working their asses off right now trying to come up with digital-friendly lessons for the month. \\n\\nIf you’re home with your child, make sure they get their work done on time. Don’t wait till the the last min for teachers to chase you. Imagine having to come up with lessons for 1-2 subjects for &gt;2 classes EVERYDAY while practically begging your kids to finish their work. Make it easier for the teachers to guide your kids. What would be good is to set a routine (like a timetable for the month) with your children. So they don’t wait till 9pm to get started on their work.   \\n\\nIf there are technical difficulties, give feedback in a respectful manner. I heard some teachers got chewed up last week because they couldn’t log in (like it’s their fault??!?!). Also, please don’t compare between classes and ask “how come that class have this but my kid’s class isn’t have?”. If it’s there’s a huge discrepancy, take it up to the teacher in a nice way. Don’t be demanding. Ask for a reason, and give suggestions. Again, pls remember that you gave your 1/2 kids, teachers have 40 in a class. Teachers will obviously have the interest of the whole class at heart, not just your kids’. \\n\\nI also heard that last week, there were students taking HBL lightly- as if it’s a holiday. HBL is implemented such that there’s still teaching/learning taking place. If you/your kids have such an opinion, it’d be good to reset your thinking before the start of HBL. The HBL packages are not the “provided by MOE so teachers just need to assign” kind. Teachers come up with their own packages, keeping in mind the learning profile of their students. So take them seriously! \\n\\nTLDR: All you have to do is to follow teacher’s instructions and see them as humans, not machines. If there’re any problems, take it in stride and consult the teachers in s respectful way.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Inspired by a work group chat(s) that popped up in the past weeks or so. But personally, I always like to keep a line drawn between \"work people\" and \"people people\". But that\\'s just me.\\n\\nI was wondering, if there\\'s interest here, or already some existing groups out there you\\'d be keen to share. What I\\'m primarily aiming for is for people to connect with who:\\n\\n1) Are alone, live alone (so don\\'t necessarily have that SO, or family in a household). Sure we all have our existing group of friends, people we interact with, but I thought also something new/fresh/different. That and in these times, us (and introverts) are finding ourselves more and more alone. And it can mess with your head, it\\'d be nice just to have a friendly &amp; safe space online just to have people to connect with.\\n\\n2) NOT looking for a group which is just doom and gloom, and discussing the news. We read the news now (more then ever). This is to escape all that, just to support one another, check-in on each others day, share some memes, to try to look at the silver linings in these times.\\n\\n3) I\\'d prefer anonymity - I\\'m not looking for my next BFF. Just looking for other people in the same boat, but also not feel forced to come out of their shell too much. It\\'s meant to be a safe space. So, no need to share selfies, private information (share what you want). Thus, a more open platform, say like Kik? Mewe?\\n\\nSo if anyone is keen on this. Let me know (personally I would like to use KIK, because it\\'s my main platform I use, but I am flexible). If you are already part of such a community and are opening up, I\\'d (and maybe a couple of people here) would be keen to join.\\n\\nKeep smiling people.
